Airdrop/batch send smart contracts are a great way to consolidate knowledge after learning a new programming language.

The aim is simple: Instead of sending to multiple recipients in multiple transactions that use a lot of gas, you can send everything with one function and pay gas once. It’s all about saving fees in one clean transaction.

## Building an Airdrop Package

First, you’ll need to create the project if you don’t have one already.

You know the drill; execute this command and open your project in your IDE of choice.

```bash [Terminal]
sui move new airdrop
cd airdrop
```

Now, declare the module like this:

```move [sui.move]
module airdrop::mass_send;
```

These are the imports you’ll need. The `Coin` module for working with coins and the `event` module for emitting events.

```move [sui.move]
use sui::coin::{Self, Coin};
use sui::event;
```

Now, define your event struct like this:

```move [sui.move]
public struct AirdropEvent has copy, drop {
    amount: u64,
    recipient: address,
}
```

You can optionally define custom error codes. In this case, we need to make sure the lengths or the vectors match:

```move [sui.move]
const E_LENGTH_MISMATCH: u64 = 0;
```

Here's the main function signature. It takes a coin, a list of recipient addresses, and the amounts each one should receive.

```move [sui.move]
public entry fun send_by_allocation<T: store>(
    coin: &mut Coin<T>,
    recipients: vector<address>,
    amounts: vector<u64>,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
)
```

Now, we can compare the lengths of the recipient vectors and amounts to ensure that every recipient has an allocation.

```move [sui.move]
let num_recipients = vector::length(&recipients);
let num_amounts = vector::length(&amounts);
assert!(num_recipients == num_amounts, E_LENGTH_MISMATCH);
```

The final piece in the puzzle is to use a loop to transfer tokens to all the recipients with the `public_transfer` function.

```move [sui.move]
let mut i = 0;
while (i < num_recipients) {
   let amount = *vector::borrow(&amounts, i);
   let recipient = *vector::borrow(&recipients, i);
   let portion = coin::split(coin, amount, ctx);
   transfer::public_transfer(portion, recipient);


   event::emit(AirdropEvent {
            amount,
            recipient,
        });

                i = i + 1;
    };
}
```

In the loop, you split the coin into the amount allocated for the specific recipient before sending it. Every transfer emits an event.

Best part? It’s all one transaction. One gas fee.

Now build the project for some house keeping. Everything should work fine.

```move [sui.move]
sui move build
```

Once it builds successfully, you can publish to the Sui network with this command.

```move [sui.move]
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
```

Once you’ve published you can call the function via Sui CLI like this to airdrop to multiple recipients:

```bash [Terminal]
sui client call \
  --package <YOUR_PACKAGE_ID> \
  --module mass_send \
  --function send_by_allocation \
  --args <COIN_OBJECT_ID> \
         '[<RECIPIENT_1>, <RECIPIENT_2>, ...]' \
         '[<AMOUNT_1>, <AMOUNT_2>, ...]' \
  --type-args <TOKEN_TYPE> \
  --gas-budget 10000000
```

Replace the arguments with actual values and you’re good to go. Your recipients should recieve the coins you specify.

## Conclusion

You’ve learned to execute an airdrop without spending so much on gas. Sui’s object-centric model and parallel execution engine make this kind of flow not just possible, but *natural*.

With a single transaction, you can send tokens to dozens (or hundreds) of recipients; there is no need for multiple calls or gas fees.
