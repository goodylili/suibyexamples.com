# Launching NFTs with Kiosk

Sui provides kiosks that are more ergonomic than on-chain assets. It’s like opening a brand for items, and then you get to specify and enforce policies over the items.

Many of your favourite NFT collections, including Prime Machin and Rootlets, use Kiosk.

First, you need to add all these imports to your package.

```move [sui.move]
use sui::url::Url;
use std::string::String;
use sui::balance::Balance;
use sui::sui::SUI;
use sui::coin::{Self, Coin};
use sui::balance;
use sui::transfer_policy::{Self, TransferPolicy, TransferPolicyCap, TransferRequest};

const E_INSUFFICIENT_AMOUNT: u64 = 0;
```

You’re importing the usual suspects: strings, coins, and balances plus `transfer_policy`, which is the real star of this section.

The `transfer_policy` module defines **how assets can be transferred** and enforces rules on those transfers.

Here’s a table of the transfer policy features:

| Feature | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `TransferPolicy<T>` | A shared object that defines the rules for transferring type `T` |
| `TransferPolicyCap<T>` | A capability (object) that lets you **modify** the policy — only the holder can change or add rules |
| `TransferRequest<T>` | An object created whenever someone tries to transfer type `T`. They must fulfill the policy rules before the transfer is finalized |
| `add_rule(...)` | Adds a custom rule (like “pay 1 SUI”) to the policy |
| `add_to_balance(...)` | Lets you collect fees or payments tied to transfers |
| `add_receipt(...)` | Marks a rule as fulfilled for a given transfer |
| `confirm_request(...)` | Finalizes a transfer if **all** rules are met |

Now that you understand the transfer policy. Let’s define the NFT struct and specify transfer policies on the NFT.

```move [sui.move]
public struct Art has key, store {
    id: UID,
    name: String,
    url: Url,
    balance: Balance<SUI>,
}
```

We’ll need to define a **rule** and a **configuration t**o charge a fee or enforce conditions:

```move [sui.move]
public struct Rule has drop {}
public struct Config has store, drop {}
```

This creates a new rule type, `Rule`, and an empty `Config`. We’ll plug this into the policy later.

Here’s a basic function to mint a new `Art` NFT:

```move [sui.move]
/// Mint an NFT (for demo/testing)
public fun mint(name: String, url: Url, ctx: &mut TxContext): Art {
    Art {
        id: object::new(ctx),
        name,
        url,
        balance: balance::zero(),
    }
}
```

It creates a new object and assigns it a name, image, and zero token balance.

Now we need to create a transfer policy like this:

```move [sui.move]
#[allow(lint(share_owned, self_transfer))]
public fun create_policy(publisher: &sui::package::Publisher, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    let (policy, cap) = transfer_policy::new<Art>(publisher, ctx);
    transfer::public_share_object(policy);
    transfer::public_transfer(cap, tx_context::sender(ctx));
}
```

Here’s what’s happening:

- `transfer_policy::new` creates the policy and its capability (`cap`)
- The policy is made **shared** so everyone can access it
- The cap is **transferred** to the caller so only they can manage the policy

This step is mandatory. Without a policy, Kiosk listings won’t be enforceable.

Now, we can  attach the rule to the policy like this:

```move [sui.move]
public fun add_rule(
    policy: &mut TransferPolicy<Art>,
    cap: &TransferPolicyCap<Art>
) {
    transfer_policy::add_rule(Rule {}, policy, cap, Config {});
}

```

This registers your custom rule (`Rule`) and its config. This function can only be called by whoever holds the `TransferPolicyCap`.

Here’s the critical part: enforcing a **1 SUI transfer fee:**

```move [sui.move]
public fun pay(
    policy: &mut TransferPolicy<Art>,
    request: &mut TransferRequest<Art>,
    coin: Coin<SUI>
) {
    assert!(coin::value(&coin) == 1_000_000_000, E_INSUFFICIENT_AMOUNT);
    transfer_policy::add_to_balance(Rule {}, policy, coin);
    transfer_policy::add_receipt(Rule {}, request);
}
```

What’s happening here:

- It checks the coin’s value is exactly **1 SUI** (in Mist)
- Adds that payment to the policy’s internal balance
- Marks the `TransferRequest` as passed for this rule

Once all rules are satisfied, the buyer must **confirm the request**:

```move [sui.move]
public fun confirm(
    policy: &TransferPolicy<Art>,
    request: TransferRequest<Art>
) {
    transfer_policy::confirm_request(policy, request);
}
```

The transfer is considered pending until this step is completed, and ownership won’t be finalized.

This step is essential. Without calling `confirm_request()`, the item is stuck in limbo. That’s why TradePort asks recipients to claim from Kiosks.

## Conclusion

You now know how to launch Kiosks on Sui. Most of the Kiosks I've interacted with are for NFT collections. But Kiosks are great for everything commercial really.
