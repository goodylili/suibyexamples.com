# Sui & Move Overview

Move is the secure and resource-oriented programming language  for building on the Sui blockchain.

It’s designed to manage digital assets safely and efficiently, giving developers fine-grained control over how assets are created, transferred, and stored.

Originally developed by Meta for Diem, Move was adopted and evolved by Mysten Labs to power Sui, a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain built for speed, scalability, and smart contract safety.

Unlike traditional programming languages that treat data like generic variables, Move introduces a new concept: ***resources***. In Move, resources are first-class citizens; they can’t be copied or accidentally dropped.

This is cool because assets like NFTs or tokens are handled with cryptographic-level safety.

Instead of garbage collection or manual memory management, Move uses *ownership* and *move semantics*. Each value in Move has exactly one owner at a time, and when that value is moved, the original reference becomes invalid.

This avoids double-spends and dangling references—two common bugs in smart contract development.

## Sui Move Extends on Move

Sui Move extends the core Move language with new features like object-centric programming. On Sui, everything is treated as an object with a unique ID—a coin, a smart contract, or a game item.

These objects live on-chain and can be passed between users, upgraded, or mutated using Move functions called *entry functions*.

To get started with Sui Move, install the Sui CLI and initialize a new project with `sui move new`. Write your modules in `.move` files and define structs, functions, and resources.

Use the `entry` keyword to declare public entry points for your smart contracts. Then compile your code with `sui move build` and test it locally before deploying.

Sui Move has a powerful standard library and frameworks for handling complex operations, from capability-based access control to programmable transactions.

You’re ready to  build a secure, asset-centric smart contract on one of the fastest blockchains. That’s Sui Move in 100 seconds.
