# Sui & Move Overview


Move is the secure and resource-oriented programming language  for building on the Sui blockchain. It’s designed to manage digital assets safely and efficiently, giving developers fine-grained control over how assets are created, transferred, and stored.

Originally developed by Meta for Diem, Move was adopted and evolved by Mysten Labs to power Sui, a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain built for speed, scalability, and smart contract safety.

Unlike traditional programming languages that treat data like generic variables, Move introduces a new concept: ***resources***. In Move, resources are first-class citizens; they can’t be copied or accidentally dropped.

```move [vanilla.move]
module 0x0::TokenExample {
    use std::signer;

    struct Token has key {
        value: u64
    }

    public fun create(account: &signer, amount: u64) {
        move_to(account, Token { value: amount });
    }

    public fun get_value(addr: address): u64 acquires Token {
        borrow_global<Token>(addr).value
    }
}
```

This is cool because assets like NFTs or tokens are handled with cryptographic-level safety.

Instead of garbage collection or manual memory management, Move uses *ownership* and *move semantics*. Each value in Move has exactly one owner at a time, and when that value is moved, the original reference becomes invalid.

This avoids double-spends and dangling references—two common bugs in smart contract development.

## Sui Move Extends on Move

Sui Move is a variant of Move (different from the original version). Sui Move extends the core Move language with new features like object-centric programming.

On Sui, everything is treated as an object with a unique ID—a coin, a smart contract, or a game item. These objects live on-chain and can be passed between users, upgraded, or mutated using Move functions called *entry functions*.



```move [sui.move]
module sui_example::token {
    use sui::object::{Self, UID};
    use sui::transfer;
    use sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};

    struct Token has key, store {
        id: UID,
        value: u64
    }

    public entry fun create(value: u64, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        let token = Token {
            id: object::new(ctx),
            value
        };
        transfer::public_transfer(token, tx_context::sender(ctx));
    }
}
```
To get started with Sui Move, install the Sui CLI and initialize a new project with `sui move new`. Write your modules in `.move` files and define structs, functions, and resources.

Use the `entry` keyword to declare public entry points for your smart contracts. Then compile your code with `sui move build` and test it locally before deploying.



Sui Move has a powerful standard library and frameworks for handling complex operations, from capability-based access control to programmable transactions.

You’re ready to  build a secure, asset-centric smart contract on one of the fastest blockchains. That’s Sui Move in 100 seconds.
