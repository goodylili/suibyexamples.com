# Sui CLI Cheat Sheet

When building smart contracts, you’ll also need to build a client that interacts with the smart contract. Aside from querying on-chain data, Clients can read and execute smart contracts depending on the primitives defined in the contract.

Sui CLI is your best bet for a client since you can easily make CLI calls from any language you eventually decide to build clients with. In this article, I’ll provide an overview of the popular commands you’ll need while building on Sui.

## Getting Started with Sui CLI

First, you’ll need to install Sui CLI on your computer. Depending on the operating system and package manager you’re using, here’s how you can install Sui CLI on your computer:

Execute this command on your terminal to install Sui CLI if you’re running a Unix-based operating system (macOS or Linux) via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```bash [Terminal]
brew install sui
```

Execute this command on your terminal to install Sui CLI if you’re running Windows via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).

```bash [Terminal]
choco install sui
```

Another route you can use is the Cargo (Rust package manager) route. First, you’ll need to have Rust installed (ships with cargo) and then execute this command to install Sui CLI.

```bash [Terminal]
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch testnet sui --features tracing
```

You can always execute the `--version` flag to verify your installation and check the version of Sui CLI you have installed.

```bash [Terminal]
sui --version
```

One flag you’ll use frequently is the—`- help` flag for the description of every command.

```bash [Terminal]
sui --help
```

It works with almost every command. It should be your mantle whenever you’re stuck.

Regardless of the command, using `-h` or `--help` for help would always be handy.

### Environment Management with Sui CLI

Every chain provides you with three fundamental networks: Mainnet, Testnet, and Devnet. You can also spawn a test chain locally to keep development in stealth mode.

Here’s the command you’ll execute to spawn a local network.

```bash [Terminal]
RUST_LOG="off,sui_node=info" sui start --with-faucet --force-regenesis
```

The command calls the Sui CLI binary to start a faucet service and generate a new genesis block without persisting the local network state.

Now, you can connect to the local network with the `new-env` command like this:

```bash [Terminal]
sui client new-env --alias local --rpc <rpc-url>

# sui client new-env --alias local --rpc http://127.0.0.1:9000
```

You can switch and activate any environment with this general command.

```bash [Terminal]
sui client switch --env <ENV_NAME>
```

Now,  you can use this command to set the active environment to the new `local` environment you’ve created.

```bash [Terminal]
sui client switch --env local
```

The command switches the currently active environment to the local network you’re running.

## Address and Key Management with Sui CLI

You’ll be switching keys as you deploy smart contracts over the Sui CLI, so here’s how to do that.

You can view the currently active address with the `active-address` command

```bash [Terminal]
sui client active-address
```

You can list all the addresses in your client with the `addresses` command.

```bash [Terminal]
sui client addresses
```

You can switch addresses as you please with the `--address` flag before specifying the address.

## Key Management with Sui CLI

When building your apps, for security or other reasons, you might want to run CLI commands to work with keys. The `keytool` command is

You can list all the keys in a keystore with the `list` command like this:

```bash [Terminal]
sui keytool list
```

You can generate keys with the `generate` command followed with a specification of the scheme.

```bash [Terminal]
sui keytool generate [OPTIONS] <KEY_SCHEME> [DERIVATION_PATH] [WORD_LENGTH]
```

You’re probably familiar with the `ed25519` since that’s what most wallets use. Specify it like this.

```bash [Terminal]
sui keytool generate ed25519
```

You should get the output with the Sui address, mnemonic and other details.

<img src="/generate-key-cli.png" alt="Generate Key Sui CLI"/>

The keypair should be private, if you’re generating for users then only users should see it, you should neither see it nor log it for any reasons.

You can also import Keypair from existing mnemonic with the `import command`.

```bash [Terminal]
sui keytool import "<MNEMONIC_PHRASE>" ed25519
```

When you’ve imported it, you can switch to the keypair and start sending transactions with it.

## Gas and Faucet with Sui CLI

When you’re developing your apps, ideally, you’ll start out on devnet, then testnet before deploying to mainnet.

Devnet and Testnet gas are free to acquire. But mainnet? nah.

You can easily request gas on devnet with the `client faucet` command:

```bash [Terminal]
sui client faucet
```

For testnet, you’ll need to execute this cURL command to request gas:

```bash [Terminal]
curl --location --request POST 'https://faucet.devnet.sui.io/v1/gas' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "FixedAmountRequest": {
        "recipient": "<YOUR SUI ADDRESS>"
    }
}'
```

You can also visit [the official Sui faucet website](https://faucet.sui.io/) to claim some Devnet and Testnet tokens.

Use the `client gas` command to check the client’s available gas tokens on the current environment.

```bash [Terminal]
sui client gas
```

For mainnet transactions, you’ll need to acquire Sui from exchanges and fund your wallet.

## Publishing Packages

You can publish packages on to the Sui network with the `client publish` command.

```bash [Terminal]
sui client publish [OPTIONS] [package_path]
```

Here’s an example command for publishing a package with `5000000` MIST gas budget.

```bash [Terminal]
sui client publish --gas-budget 5000000
```

The gas budget isn’t fixed, you most likely want to check onchain for a suitable gas amount and pay it forward.

## Coin Management with Sui CLI

When you’re working with SUI coins, You’ll probably need to merge and split them often—especially when youjuggling gas or sending different amounts to various contracts or users.

If you’ve have two coins lying around, and you want to consolidate them, use the `merge-coin` command like this:

```bash [Terminal]
sui client merge-coin --primary-coin <COIN_ID> --coin-to-merge <COIN_ID>
```

The `primary-coin` is the one you’ll keep, and the `coin-to-merge` is the one that gets absorbed.

Need to split a coin instead? Maybe you want to pay out to multiple recipients or just need different denominations. You can slice a coin up using `split-coin` like this:

```bash [Terminal]
sui client split-coin --coin-id <COIN_ID> --amounts <AMOUNTS>
```

If you need to send out coins, you’ll use the `client transfer-sui` command like this:

```bash [Terminal]
sui client transfer-sui --sui-coin-object-id <COIN_ID> --to <ADDRESS>
```

It’s a simple handoff—you give it the coin ID and the recipient’s address, and it moves the funds.

Sui has programmable transactions so you can send to multiple recipients at once with the `pay-sui` command:

```bash [Terminal]
sui client pay-sui --input-coins <COIN_ID> --recipients <ADDRESS> --amounts <AMOUNTS>
```

You’ll pass a coin (or a list of coins), and then specify the recipients and how much each should get. It’s perfect for batch payments or distributing tokens in bulk.

## Object Management with Sui CLI

Sui is all about objects. Contracts, tokens, and even your coins—they're all objects.

To get detailed info on any object, just call:

```bash [Terminal]
sui client object <OBJECT_ID>
```

This will spit out all the metadata, owner info, and anything else the object is carrying.

If your object has dynamic fields (like a registry or a growing data structure), you can dig into those too:

```bash [Terminal]
sui client dynamic-field <DYNAMIC_FIELD_ID>
```

This is very handy feature you might use often during development.

## Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTBs)

Sui is one of the few chains with native PTBs. Programmable Transaction Blocks let you bundle multiple operations into a single transaction—kinda like a mini-script that executes on-chain.

Say you need to call a Move function directly from your CLI. You’ll do that like this:

```bash [Terminal]
sui client ptb --move-call <PACKAGE>::<MODULE>::<FUNCTION> "<TYPE>" <ARGS>
```

Replace the package address, module name, and function you’re targeting. Then drop in the type and arguments as needed.

And if you want to transfer multiple objects to another wallet in one go, you can use PTBs as well:

```bash [Terminal]
sui client ptb --transfer-objects "[<OBJECT_ID>]" <ADDRESS>
```

Wrap the object IDs in brackets if you’re sending more than one, and finish it off with the recipient’s address.
